# Maintenance

This document describes steps required to maintain the
[`wolfram-cli`](../README.md) project.

### `wolfram-cli` command-line executable help text

This maintenance task should be run every time the `wolfram-cli` command-line
interface changes.

[`CommandLineHelp.md`](./CommandLineHelp.md) contains the `--help` text for the
`wolfram-cli` command-line tool. Storing this overview of the help text in a
markdown file makes the functionality of `wolfram-cli` more discoverable, and
serves as an informal "cheet sheet" of reference material. Creation of the contents
of `CommandLineHelp.md` is partially automated by the undocumented `print-all-help`
subcommand:

```shell
$ wolfram-cli print-all-help
```

To update `CommandLineHelp.md`, perform the following steps:

1. Begin by deleting everything in `CommandLineHelp.md` after the line:

   ```html
   <!-- BEGIN AUTOGENERATED CONTENT -->
   ```

2. Save the help text formatted as readable markdown sections by executing:

   ```shell
   cargo run -- print-all-help --markdown >> docs/CommandLineHelp.md
   ```

   This will automatically append the generated Markdown content to
   `CommandLineHelp.md`.

3. Commit the updates with a commit message like: `chore: Regenerate CommandLineHelp.md`.
